            <h4 class="h4">Czech Republic</h4>
            <p class="p">The Czech Republic is not a geographically large country, but it has a rich and eventful history. From
                time immemorial, Czechs, Germans, Jews and Slovaks, as well as Italian stonemasons and stucco workers,
                French tradesmen and deserters from Napoleonâ€™s army, have all lived and worked here, all influencing one
                another. For centuries they jointly cultivated their land, creating works that still command respect and
                admiration today. It is thanks to their inventiveness and skill that this small country is graced with
                hundreds of ancient castles, monasteries and stately mansions, and even entire towns that give the
                impression of being comprehensive artifacts. The Czech Republic contains a vast amount of architectural
                treasure, as well as beautiful forests and mountains to match.</p>
